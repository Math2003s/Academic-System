# Academic System

Welcome to the Academic System Project! This software is designed for registering, displaying, and deleting student records in an academic system. The project is developed in Java using web resources such as JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlet files. Please note that the project is still under development.

## Introduction

The Academic System is an essential tool for educational institutions, ranging from schools to universities. It facilitates the management of student information, offering an effective solution for monitoring academic progress and keeping records up-to-date.

## Features

- **Register Students:** Add new students to the academic system with details like name, ID, courses, and other relevant information.
- **Display Student Records:** View a comprehensive list of all registered students and their associated details.
- **Delete Student Records:** Remove student records when students leave or are no longer part of the academic system.

## Technologies Used
